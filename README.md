## Poker Analysis Desktop Applicaiton

This is a work in progress version of a poker analysis tool that uses output files from online poker sites to provide player statistics, hand details, and potential weaknesses in play.

To build this project, first run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After that, you should be able to use `python app.py` to start the application. Eventually, this application will be packaged into an executable file.
